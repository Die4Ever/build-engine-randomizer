Download build-engine-randomizer.exe from [the Assets section on the Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/build-engine-randomizer/releases). Put eduke32.exe/nblood.exe/etc into the game's folder. Run the Randomizer it, point it to the game's GRP file, choose your settings, and click Randomize! Make sure you have a backup of your game files first just in case. On Windows the Randomizer will generate a bat file for you to play, and then you can just play the game as normal, choose which episode and which difficulty, and it will automatically use the new map files. You do NOT select "USER MAP" in the game menus. If you don't get a bat file, then [see the wiki](https://github.com/Die4Ever/build-engine-randomizer/wiki#how-to-use) for how to play.

Randomizes enemies and items. For games that use CON files (Duke Nukem 3D and Ion Fury so far) it also randomizes values like maximum health and ammo values, and enemy strengths. Also supports randomizing the map order. Be warned that putting every setting to maximum will make the game nearly impossible. I suggest you start with the default settings. Also check out the Randomizer.html file that gets created in the output directory to see what's changed.
