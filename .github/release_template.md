Build Engine Randomizer currently supports: Duke Nukem 3D, Ion Fury, Shadow Warrior (1997), Blood, and PowerSlave/Exhumed (and maybe more in the future!)

Download build-engine-randomizer.exe from the Assets section below. Run it, point it to the game's GRP file, choose your settings, and click Randomize! Make sure you have a backup of your game files first.

For info on where to get the games and how to run them, [check out our wiki here](https://github.com/Die4Ever/build-engine-randomizer/wiki).

Randomizes enemies and items. For games that use CON files (Duke Nukem 3D and Ion Fury so far) it also randomizes values like maximum health and ammo values, and enemy strengths. Be warned that putting every setting to maximum will make the game nearly impossible. I suggest you start with the default settings. Also check out the Randomizer.html file that gets created in the output directory to see what's changed.
